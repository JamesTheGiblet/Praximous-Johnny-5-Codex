### <a name="project-ethos"></a> Project Ethos: A Living Artifact

Johnny 5 "Number 3" is more than a robot; he is a testament to the power of narrative-infused design. His body speaks in color-coded glyphs, his mind communicates in an interlinked mesh of three distinct processors, and his every action is a step in a sacred, documented ritual. This build is a journey—a challenge to move beyond simple assembly and into the realm of creation.

### <a name="core-blueprint"></a> Explore the Core Blueprint

The core of the Johnny 5 "Number 3" artifact is its multi-brain architecture and modular design. The build is structured around a series of key subsystems:

| Subsystem          | Purpose                             | Key Components                                                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **chassis.motion** | Locomotion & power foundation       | RC tank kit, dual DC motors, PPTC fuses                                     |
| **brain.triad**    | The multi-brain architecture        | Pi 5, Pi Zero 2 W, ESP32-CAM                                                |
| **power.nexus**    | Clean power distribution            | 2S/3S LiPo, buck converters, Evemodel PCB                                   |
| **voice.core**     | Audio input/output system           | Mic, Amp, Speaker, Hardware/Software TTS                                    |
| **limb.motion**    | Actuators for expressive movement   | Servos, linear actuators, bushings                                          |
| **sensor.vision**  | Perception & feedback               | IMU, ultrasonic sensors, OLED eyes, ESP32-CAM                               |

Each part is chosen for its specific role in the ritual, ensuring a harmonious and powerful build.
