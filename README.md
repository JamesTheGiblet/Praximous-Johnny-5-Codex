# Praximous Codex: Johnny 5 "Number 3" - Ritual Heartbeat

![JTG Logo](assets/jtg_logo.png)

A sovereign robotics artifact designed as part of the Praximous Codex, this project embodies the principles of **Mythic Modularity** and **Ritual Engineering**. This repository serves as the public archive and open blueprint for the Johnny 5 build, detailing the ethos, components, and foundational rituals that bring the artifact to life.

### <a name="project-ethos"></a> Project Ethos: A Living Artifact

Johnny 5 "Number 3" is more than a robot; he is a testament to the power of narrative-infused design. His body speaks in color-coded glyphs, his mind communicates in an interlinked mesh of three distinct processors, and his every action is a step in a sacred, documented ritual. This build is a journey—a challenge to move beyond simple assembly and into the realm of creation.

### <a name="glimpse-of-ritual"></a> A Glimpse into the Build Ritual

The Praximous Codex is a journey. The build is organized into six distinct phases, each with its own archetype and ritual purpose. While the full documentation is reserved for the premium roadmap, here is a brief overview of the stages of becoming:

#### Phase Table of Contents
* [Phase I: Foundation & Ritual Prep](#phase-1)
* [Phase II: Neural Mesh Awakening](#phase-2)
* [Phase III: Voice & Expression Layer](#phase-3)
* [Phase IV: Limb Articulation & Feedback](#phase-4)
* [Phase V: Spatial Awareness & Intelligence](#phase-5)
* [Phase VI: Documentation & Lore Sync](#phase-6)

**<a name="phase-1"></a>1. Phase I: Foundation & Ritual Prep** — "The Summoning"
* **Purpose:** To establish the physical and electrical foundation of the artifact.
* **Focus:** Chassis assembly, clean power distribution, and the initial boot sequence.

**<a name="phase-2"></a>2. Phase II: Neural Mesh Awakening** — "Split Consciousness"
* **Purpose:** To activate the multi-brain architecture and synchronize the processors.
* **Focus:** Inter-brain communication, diagnostic pulses, and thermal management.

**<a name="phase-3"></a>3. Phase III: Voice & Expression Layer** — "The Echoed Self"
* **Purpose:** To give the artifact a voice, an identity, and a means of expression.
* **Focus:** Audio input/output systems, TTS configuration, and visual emotion.

**<a name="phase-4"></a>4. Phase IV: Limb Articulation & Feedback** — "Gestures of Becoming"
* **Purpose:** To grant the artifact precise, expressive, and self-aware movement.
* **Focus:** Servo installation, feedback-enabled actuators, and gesture mapping.

**<a name="phase-5"></a>5. Phase V: Spatial Awareness & Intelligence** — "Eye of the Wanderer"
* **Purpose:** To grant the artifact a deep understanding of its environment and its place within it.
* **Focus:** Navigation sensors, vision tracking, and API integrations.

**<a name="phase-6"></a>6. Phase VI: Documentation & Lore Sync** — "The Archivist’s Scroll"
* **Purpose:** To render the artifact's journey and persona into a living, documented codex.
* **Focus:** Finalizing documentation, creating the UI overlay, and preparing for expansion.

### <a name="core-blueprint"></a> Explore the Core Blueprint

The core of the Johnny 5 "Number 3" artifact is its multi-brain architecture and modular design. The build is structured around a series of key subsystems:

| Subsystem          | Purpose                             | Key Components                                                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **chassis.motion** | Locomotion & power foundation       | RC tank kit, dual DC motors, PPTC fuses                                     |
| **brain.triad**    | The multi-brain architecture        | Pi 5, Pi Zero 2 W, ESP32-CAM                                                |
| **power.nexus**    | Clean power distribution            | 2S/3S LiPo, buck converters, Evemodel PCB                                   |
| **voice.core**     | Audio input/output system           | Mic, Amp, Speaker, Hardware/Software TTS                                    |
| **limb.motion**    | Actuators for expressive movement   | Servos, linear actuators, bushings                                          |
| **sensor.vision**  | Perception & feedback               | IMU, ultrasonic sensors, OLED eyes, ESP32-CAM                               |

Each part is chosen for its specific role in the ritual, ensuring a harmonious and powerful build.
